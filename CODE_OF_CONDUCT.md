# Techlahoma Foundation Code of Conduct

## What to Expect From Techlahoma Regarding Our Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy
All attendees of in-person events and online gatherings are expected to follow our Code of Conduct, which includes our anti-harassment policy. The COC holds attendees to regard themselves in a professional and collaborative manner while engaging in any Techlahoma activity. If you need help with a COC violation or require any immediate assistance, consider following any of these steps below:
* Contact police, if needed
* Contact your event organizers right away
* Join and post in the public Techlahoma Slack channel #ask-a-mod to contact all admins
* Contact all Slack admins in any channel by typing @admins
* Send an email at info@techlahoma.org to the Techlahoma organizer team

Techlahoma leadership is here to support safe, fun, educational, professional and friendly events. If you or someone else needs help, don't hesitate to contact us. We can help you file a police report if that situation is needed, escort you to your vehicle, stay with you for the duration of an event, remove threatening/coc-violating individuals, refund your ticket, and more to help you feel recognized and accommodated. It's our responsibility to take your safety concerns seriously.
